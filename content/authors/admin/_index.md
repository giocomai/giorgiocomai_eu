I am a researcher and data analyst at [OBCT/CCI](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/). Here is some information about my (admittedly, non-contiguous) professional interests.

In recent years, I have been working as a data analyst and consultant, crunching data at the European Data Journalism Network ([EDJNet](https://europeandatajournalism.eu/)), writing code in the R programming language, and working on data visualisation and geographic data analysis.

For a long time, I have been conducting research on post-Soviet affairs, focusing in particular on de facto states. I have been visiting Russia and other post-Soviet countries since 2000, and I speak fluently Russian and Romanian.

I occasionally post on my data visualisation blog: [`the codebase`](https://codebase.giorgiocomai.eu/).
