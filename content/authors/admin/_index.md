I am a researcher and data analyst at [OBCT/CCI](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/). 

I am currently working on a research project dedicated to text as data (and data in the text): find out more on [tadadit.xyz](https://tadadit.xyz/).

For a long time, I have been conducting research on post-Soviet affairs, focusing in particular on de facto states. I have been visiting Russia and other post-Soviet countries since 2000, and I speak fluently Russian and Romanian. I am a member of the board of directors of Asiac, the Italian Association for the study of Central Asia and the Caucasus.

In recent years, I have increasingly been working on structured approaches for analysing online sources in conflict studies and international relations, data collection methods, and related ethical issues.

I have also been working as a data analyst and consultant, crunching data at the European Data Journalism Network ([EDJNet](https://europeandatajournalism.eu/)), writing code and developing [packages in the R programming language](https://github.com/giocomai/), and working on data visualisation and geographic data analysis.

I occasionally post on my data visualisation blog: [`the codebase`](https://codebase.giorgiocomai.eu/).

Find me micro-blogging in the Fediverse <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@giocomai">@giocomai@mastodon.social</a>.
