“Youth in the Northern Caucasus: associationism, identity, and patriotism in a complex, multi-ethnic context”, is a research project I conducted in 2009-2011, financed by *Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto*.

Outputs included a number of feature pieces from the region, as well as research papers.

See some of the pictures I took at youth camps in [Seliger](https://www.flickr.com/photos/giocomai/albums/72157624359261441) and [Mashuk](https://www.flickr.com/photos/giocomai/albums/72157624807786026) in 2010.
