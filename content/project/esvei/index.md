I am lead researcher in OBCT's project [ESVEI](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Projects2/ESVEI/), “Exploring systemic vulnerabilities for external influence in Italy”, an initative co-sponsored by the Open Society Initiative For Europe - Open Society Foundations. It tackles structural issues that in recent years are increasing the vulnerability to external interference of democratic processes, taking Italy as a case study.

It aims at increasing awareness, initiating policy debates, and providing sensible, forward-looking policy recommendations in three domains that are central to democratic processes in modern societies, but that, due to inadequate regulations and poor practices, needlessly expose such processes to meddling:

- social media and disinformation;
- transparency of funding and lobbying;   
- cybersecurity
