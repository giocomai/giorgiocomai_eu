I am contributing to an initiative based on creating [a digital archive](https://archiviomemoria.ecomuseovalledeilaghi.it/) in my native valley in Trentino. 

I have shared in detail some of the considerations that determined the choice of the platform used to host the digital archive, as well as the structure used for the metadata ([available in Italian](istruzioniarchiviomemoria.ecomuseovalledeilaghi.it)).

In the process, I have contributed to the digital ecosystem we rely on in this context:
- I have contributed to the quality of OpenStreetMap in the villages of our valley
- I have significantly contributed to the translation in Italian of [Omeka S](omeka.org/), the open source platform used to host the digital archive; 
- I have translated into Italian [Tropy](https://tropy.org/), a free and open-source desktop knowledge organization application that helps users manage and describe photographs of research materials.
