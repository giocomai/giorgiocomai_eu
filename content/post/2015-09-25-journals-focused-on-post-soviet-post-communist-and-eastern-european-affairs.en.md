It requires a big effort to stay up-to-date with academic publications in one's sphere of interest. I put together this post to make it easier to have at least a quick overview of what has been published recently in English-language peer-reviewed journals for those with an interest in post-Soviet, post-Communist and Eastern European affairs.

First, there's a list of the journals I think are most relevant for scholars focusing on this region, in no particular order (if you think I am missing something important, please let me know). You find it below.

Then, there's a Twitter handle: [@PostJourn](https://twitter.com/PostJourn). This will automatically post titles of new articles published on any of the journals listed on this page as they appear on-line. You'll find a preview of what is being posted on this Twitter account at the bottom of this post. If you have an interest in academic publications focused on this area, the easiest thing to do is to follow [@PostJourn](https://twitter.com/PostJourn) on Twitter.

Finally, if you want to make sure you don't miss a single article, I I suggest you use an RSS feed reader. [Here's a file](http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/postjourn-feedlist.opml) that can be used to import at once all of the feeds for the journals listed below, without the need to add each journal separately. You can download it by [clicking on this link](http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/postjourn-feedlist.opml). It can be easily imported by most RSS readers, such as [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) (online based, here's the [direct link to the import function](http://feedly.com/i/cortex)), [RssOwl](http://www.rssowl.org/) (any platform), [Liferea](http://lzone.de/liferea/) (linux only), or even email clients such as Mozilla's [Thunderbird](https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC0QFjABahUKEwjC0JuG6uzHAhVIiiwKHQ3lDkw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozilla.org%2Fthunderbird%2Fdownload&usg=AFQjCNHpdPt9eaKD0uSSBnmomXq2HSkifQ&sig2=cdmyi3CB7A9qoCirXLTRyQ). Not a one-click solution (such as following [@PostJourn](https://twitter.com/PostJourn)) but not impossibly complicated.
