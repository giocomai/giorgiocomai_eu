I was expecting flags, huge billboards, and V.V. Putin posters… no wonder I couldn’t find it! Not even a small sign at the entrance suggesting that there are the headquarters of the youth branch of Russia’s ruling party…

Anyway, I’ll come back soon to hear more about their activities in the northern Caucasus…
