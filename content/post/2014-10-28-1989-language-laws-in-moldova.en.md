The language laws introduced in Moldova in 1989 are frequently mentioned in publications dealing with inter-ethnic relations or language issues in the country or with language policies in the post-Soviet space more in general (a short reference list is included at the end of the post).

Understandably, none of them presents in detail each of these laws. However, for my own research, I decided to go through some of them.[^1]

Below, you'll find a short summary of the main provisions of individual language-related laws approved in 1989-1990, or later amendments and clarifications. Translations are my own and brevity comes necessarily at the expense of details, so I included links to the original texts for further inspection.

Of particular interest might be the choice of introducing language proficiency tests for anybody working in contact with the public (Law 3465, art. 7). After some years of debate, the provision was finally repealed (Decision 324, 1995).

Introduces language test to implement above mentioned language laws, establishing different level of language competence (from technical specific, to just oral) needed according to the occupation of each person. It makes clear that it is only required for those that need to speak or to deal with public, and that it does not apply to men older than 55 and women older than 50 do not need to take the test.

The tests test will be done gradually, starting with 1994. Heads of departments, associations, enterprises are responsible of making sure that law is respected.[^4]

HOTĂRÎRE Nr. 805 din 28.12.1993 Despre organizarea şi desfăşurarea atestării cadrelor privind nivelul de cunoaştere a limbii de stat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Varianta în limba de stat](http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view=doc&lang=1&id=308165)/[Версия на русском](http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&view=doc&id=308165&lang=2)]\
The above mentioned commission found that not all categories listed in the law can do the language testing, and lists the causes:

-   the social and political situation of the last four years has not been favourable to the study of the state language;
-   the deadlines established for studying the state language are not realistic;
-   the number of citizens that had to go through attestation has been arbitrarily increased;
-   the number of didactic cadres for teaching the state language, as well as their professional level, is not in line with the needs;
-   the programmes of the testing have not been coordinated with the materials studied at the courses, and proved to be very difficult;
-   Besides, they appeared too late, already very close to the tests;

The government will come back by 1 January 1995 with a proposal for dealing with the situation.

HOTĂRÎRE Nr. 324 din 19.05.1995 Privind aprobarea Nomenclatorului ocupaţiilor din Republica Moldova care intră sub incidenţa art. 7 din Legea cu privire la funcţionarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul Republicii Moldova şi a Modului de evaluare a gradului de cunoaştere a limbii de stat ["On the list of occupations that falls under the regulations of art. 7 of the law 'On the functioning of the languages spoken on the territory of the Moldovan SSR' and on how to evaluate the level of knowledge of the state language"]
