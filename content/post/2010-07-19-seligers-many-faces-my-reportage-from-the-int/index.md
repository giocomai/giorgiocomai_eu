[My feature about the International Youth Forum Seliger 2010 is now online on balcanicaucaso.org](http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Russia/Seliger-s-many-faces) (available in Italian [here](http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/ita/aree/Russia/Le-tante-facce-di-Seliger)).

You can find some pictures [there](http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Media/Galleries/Seliger-2010-Giorgio-Comai) or [on my Flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/giocomai/sets/72157624359261441/).

I already shared some considerations on my way back from the forum in a [previous post](../2010-07-09-notes-for-an-article-on-seliger-2010)...

And here's another recent [article about youth policies in Russia as a whole and in the Northern Caucasus in particular](http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Russia/Business-entrepreneurs-not-terrorists), that makes reference to Seliger.
