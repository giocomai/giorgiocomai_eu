Here you find Facebook interest lists and Twitter lists including the pages and public profiles of institutions, news outlets, NGOs as well as public figures related to post-Soviet de facto states.

Any Facebook or Twitter user can subscribe to these lists and follow the online activities that appear on these social media and relate to either of the post-Soviet de faco states.

Some of these lists gather a considerable number of sources (e.g. the [Abkhazia interest list](https://www.facebook.com/lists/10200252798161343) already includes more than 40 profiles and pages) while others include just a few.

These lists will be updated and will present a wider selection of resources. Indeed, you are welcome to send suggestions in the comments section below, by writing me at giorgio.comai@dcu.ie or tweeting [@giocomai](https://twitter.com/giocomai/).

Please note that the privacy settings of pages and individuals may prevent their inclusion in the lists.
