Giorgio Comai. 2021. kremlin_en - A textual dataset based on the contents published on the English-language version of the Kremlin’s website, v. 1.0, Discuss Data, [https://doi.org/10.48320/5EB1481E-AE89-45BF-9C88-03574910730A](https://doi.org/10.48320/5EB1481E-AE89-45BF-9C88-03574910730A)

An early draft of an online interface that can be used to explore the data is [available online](https://castarter.giorgiocomai.eu/kremlin_en/). Keep in mind that the interface is not yet finalised so not all options function as expected.
