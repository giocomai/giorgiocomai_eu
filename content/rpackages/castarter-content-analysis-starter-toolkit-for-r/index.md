`castarter` (now `castarter.legacy`) is designed to make it easy also for relatively inexperienced users to create a textual dataset from a website, or a section of a website, keep it up-to-date, and explore it through word frequency graphs or a web interface that makes it possibe to tag items.

Documentation is available on [`castarter`â€™s website](https://giocomai.github.io/castarter).
