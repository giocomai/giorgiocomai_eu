[`castarter`](https://github.com/giocomai/castarter) is a more modern, fully-featured, and consistent iteration of castarter - Content Analysis Starter Toolkit for the R programming language (a previous iteration is still available as [`castarter.legacy`](https://github.com/giocomai/castarter.legacy). It facilitates text mining and web scraping by taking care of many of the most common file management issues, keeps tracks of download advancement in a local database, facilitates extraction through dedicated convenience functions, and allows for basic exploration of textual corpora through a Shiny interface.

It is currently under active development.
