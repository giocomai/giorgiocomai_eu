I am a researcher and data analyst at [OBCT/CCI](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/). I am an expert on post-Soviet affairs, with research focusing in particular on de facto states and on different approaches for the bulk extraction and analysis of textual contents form the web in this context. I have been visiting regularly Russia and other post-Soviet countries since 2000, and I speak fluently Russian and Romanian.

I have developed a package for the R programming language, [`castarter`](https://giocomai.github.io/castarter/) - content analysis starter toolkit for R, and I occasionally post on my data visualisation blog: [`the codebase`](https://codebase.giorgiocomai.eu/).
